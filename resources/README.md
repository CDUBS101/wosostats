This is where you go to learn how log match stats on your own and get the templates.

*The stats generated by this project are currently publicly available [in the GitHub repo](https://github.com/amj2012/wosostats), and on the [WoSo Stats Shiny app](https://amj2012.shinyapps.io/wosostats/)*

If you'd like to contribute to our growing knowledge base about women's soccer stats, there are two ways you can direcly help:

1. **Log match actions**
2. **Add location data to logged matches**

As for competitions and teams for which there is a need for help, and for which I am confident there will be a reliable availability of downloads or replays of matches:
* **All NWSL 2016 and older season matches**
* **All USA matches**

* If there is a team or competition out there that is not listed above that you know has replays/downloads available for a significant number of matches, and if you are willing to help log matches, let me know.

Logging match actions involves picking a match for which you have a replay or download, downloading [the Excel template](https://github.com/amj2012/wosostats/blob/master/resources/match-actions-template.xlsx), and adding event info as you watch the match according to the [instructions in the how-to-log-stats.md document](https://github.com/amj2012/wosostats/blob/master/resources/how-to-log-stats.md). Logging an entire match takes a total of about 6 hours, but it is not recommended that you work on any more than one half of a match, as anything more becomes an exceedingly tremendous amount of work that can burn you out. To get started with this, have a look at [the list of competitions and matches](https://github.com/amj2012/wosostats/tree/master/source/csv) for which we already have data see what teams and matches are missing that you'd like to help log or look at the above list of teams and competitions for somewhere where you'd like to help, read thoroughly about [how to log stats](https://github.com/amj2012/wosostats/blob/master/resources/how-to-log-stats.md), and send me a DM at @WoSoStats on Twitter or email me at alfredom790@gmail.com. I will typically ask you to log the first 15 minutes of a match, just to see how you do and send you feedback before you're ready to log the entire half.

To add location data to matches that are already logged, because location data is not initially logged so as to save time and get basic stats logged first, [read throughouly about how to add location data](https://github.com/amj2012/wosostats/blob/master/resources/how-to-log-location.md), with a focus on the sections about location data, and send me a DM on Twitter at @WoSoStats or email me at alfredom790@gmail.com with what teams you'd like to help with. Logging location data for a match takes about 3 hours and involves watching a match alonside the Excel file that is already filled with action data and adding in location data for certain actions.

Thanks for your time and looking forward to, with your help, contributing to what we know about women's soccer!
